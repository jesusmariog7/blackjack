# blackjack


A simplified version of the card game of “Black-Jack” (or “Twenty-One”) using an Object Oriented approach in C++.

The aim of the game is to collect a hand of cards that sum to a value as close as possible to, but not exceeding 21. Face cards (the Jack, Queen and King) have a value of 10. Other cards have their normal face value, e.g. Ace has a value of 1, Two has a value of 2, etc. A hand that has a value greater than 21 is said to be ‘bust’ and is worth nothing.
